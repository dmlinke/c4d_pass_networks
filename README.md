# 3D Football Pass Networks with Python & Cinema4D
Make sure to download Sergio's repository for building customizable passing networks with Matplotlib at https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/passing-networks-in-python

In Python: Replace the 'Demo Eventing.ipynb' in the demo folder with 'Demo_json_export_to_c4d.ipynb'

In Cinema4D: open the script manager and import the file 'c4d_pass_network_import.py' 

Have fun!
